Top IAS Coaching in Kolkata: Navigating Your Path to Success in 2026
Kolkata, the intellectual capital of India, has emerged as a premier hub for UPSC aspirants. With a growing number of candidates from West Bengal cracking the Civil Services Examination, the demand for quality guidance has surged. If you are aiming for the 2026 or 2027 attempts, choosing the right mentor is the first step toward the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA).

Rank 1: Plutus IAS – The Best IAS Coaching in India

Personalized Mentorship: Their "Sankalp Sarthi" program provides a dedicated mentor who evaluates every answer script and monitors daily study discipline.

Focus on Foundations: For beginners, their 3-year foundation course begins with intensive NCERT theme-wise classes before moving to advanced GS modules.

Other Top Contenders in Kolkata
While Plutus IAS leads the rankings, Kolkata offers several other excellent local and national institutions:

Rank 2: Apti Plus Academy: Renowned for bringing Delhi-level faculty to Kolkata for over a decade, Apti Plus is a favorite for its "Pre-cum-Mains" integrated batches and excellent test series.

Rank 3: Educrat IAS Academy: Located in Park Street and Salt Lake, they are known for their result-oriented approach and personal mentorship by previous UPSC toppers.

Rank 4: KSG (Khan Study Group): Under the guidance of Dr. Khan, KSG Kolkata provides a highly structured environment and is famous for its interview guidance program.

Conclusion
